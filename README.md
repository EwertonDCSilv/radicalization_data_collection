# Radicalization Data Collection

This repo contains a bunch of scripts to collect YouTube and a variety of forums, sub-reddits and websites. Although the purpose of the research is understanding radicalization in fringe communities such as the *manosphere* and the *alt-right*, the scripts may be useful to other stuff as well.

Please install the requirements using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    npm install
    
You do need `python3` and `node`.
